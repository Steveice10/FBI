# servefiles

Simple Python script for serving local files to FBI's remote installer. Requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**Usage** **(Or example)**: python servefiles.py (ip) (file/directory) \[host ip\]

**NOTE USER**
If the output released will give error, most likely, you will be the ip you entered in the argument (after servefiles.py file) or, the servers do not work :(
